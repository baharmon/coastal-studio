## Site analysis

### Site visit
For our site visit to Elmer's Island on **10/02**
please bring a camera, your sketchbook,
and as a class a 32"x36" plot with contours
and another 32"x36" plot with orthoimagery.
Include a north arrow, scale, and cartographic grid on your plots.

### Research
Read the
[management plan](http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/refuge/32508-elmers-island-wildlife-refuge/elmers_island_management_plan_final.pdf)
and its [addendum](http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/refuge/32508-elmers-island-wildlife-refuge/draft_elmers_island_management_plan_addendum_031017.pdf).
As a class compile a list of plants, birds, and terrestrial and marine life
on Elmer's Island.
Then create a library of cutout *png* images
for at least 10 key species in each category.  
**Due: 10/06**
* Library of plants
* Library of birds
* Library of terrestrial and marine life

### Laser cut model
As a class build a laser cut contour model of Elmer's Island.
**Due: 10/06**
* Material: museum board (4-ply) or chipboard (1/16" thick)
* Contour interval: 0.25 m
* Tiles: grid of 6 square tiles

### Geospatial analysis and mapping
As groups of 2 compute geospatial analyses for our site.
Work through the
[terrain analysis](README.md#terrain-analysis)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
tutorials.
Then design 3 *beautiful* maps
about topics like topography, vegetation, hydrology,
sea level rise, and flood risk.
Include cartographic elements like
legends, labels, scale bars, north arrows, and cartographic grids.
**Due: 10/13**
* 3 maps
* Layout and print all 3 maps on a 36"x72" plot
* Submit digital and print versions

### Sections
Each group will
draw at least 3 sections or section-elevations.
Make the section cuts in GRASS GIS or Rhino
Based on your site visit, the orthoimagery, and your research
illustrate your sections in Photoshop and/or Illustrator
to show plant, bird, and marine communities.
**Due: 10/18**
* 3+ illustrated section-elevations

### Diagrams
Each group will draw an environmental process diagram and a concept diagram.
The first diagram should illustrate how an environmental process
like dune morphology, coastal deposition and erosion,
land loss, or bird migration
functions on Elmer's Island.
The concept diagram should highlight
what aspect of the site interests you most,
explain why it's interesting,
and suggest a solution or intervention
laying the framework for your first design moves.
**Due: 10/18**
* Environmental process diagram
* Concept diagram
